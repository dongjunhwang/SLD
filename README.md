Codes heavily build on [IRN](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/irn) and [W-OoD](https://github.com/naver-ai/w-ood). Thanks for sharing this awesome code!



> **Abstract**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) effectively reduce the pixel-level annotation cost since they use weak labels such as image-level labels.
> Although numerous studies have been conducted, they do not attention to the strong correlation between classes.
> In this paper, we analyze that a strong correlation between classes makes a poor localization map. Also, we handle this issue by using Single Label Dataset (SLD).
> To train this dataset more suitable for the classification model, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation method that makes the two networks complementary. Notably, we design several experiments to show the effectiveness of our method using qualitative and quantitative analysis.
